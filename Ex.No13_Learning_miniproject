### Program:
```
(define (domain delivery_domain)
  (:requirements :strips)
  (:predicates
    (at ?robot ?location)
    (has-package ?robot ?package)
    (at-goal ?package ?location)
    (clear ?location)
    (free ?robot)
    (package-at ?package ?location)
  )
  
  (:action move
    :parameters (?robot ?from ?to)
    :precondition (and (at ?robot ?from) (clear ?to) (free ?robot))
    :effect (and (at ?robot ?to) (clear ?from))
  )

  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?robot ?package ?location)
    :precondition (and (at ?robot ?location) (package-at ?package ?location) (free ?robot))
    :effect (and (has-package ?robot ?package) (at ?robot ?location) (not (package-at ?package ?location)))
  )

  (:action drop-off
    :parameters (?robot ?package ?location)
    :precondition (and (at ?robot ?location) (has-package ?robot ?package) (at-goal ?package ?location) (free ?robot))
    :effect (and (package-at ?package ?location) (clear ?location) (free ?robot) (not (has-package ?robot ?package)))
  )
)

```

### Output:


### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
